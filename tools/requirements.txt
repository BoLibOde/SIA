# Consolidated Python requirements for the SIA project.
# Core runtime packages used by the code in this repository.
Flask>=2.0
requests>=2.25
smbus2>=0.4.1
pygame>=2.0

# Optional / hardware-specific packages (install only if using those features)
# - RPi.GPIO is typically used on Raspberry Pi for GPIO control (optional).
# - The Adafruit CircuitPython sensor drivers are only required for legacy/alternate
#   sensor implementations found in tools/ and sketches/ (optional).
RPi.GPIO>=0.7.0
adafruit-circuitpython-bme280>=3.0.0
adafruit-circuitpython-scd4x>=1.0.0

# Notes:
# - The 'smbus' module imported in some scripts is usually provided by the OS package
#   (Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian) python3-smbus. If you cannot install the OS package,
#   use smbus2 (included above) as a pure-Python alternative.
# - If you need reproducible installs, replace >= with == and pin specific versions.
# - Flask pulls in its own dependencies (Jinja2, Werkzeug, etc.) automatically.
